# React Practice Concepts

A simple React project demonstrating core and advanced React concepts, built with Vite.

## Features & Concepts Covered

- **Component Lifecycle**: Class-based lifecycle methods (mount, update, unmount)
- **Higher-Order Components**: Reusable component logic via HOCs
- **React Routing**: Navigation using `react-router-dom`
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulate logic with custom React hooks
- **Refs & useRef**: Accessing and managing DOM nodes or values
- **useCallback**: Memoizing functions for performance
- **React Fragment**: Grouping elements without extra nodes
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading components for faster load times
- **List Virtualization**: Efficiently rendering large lists
- **Lazy Loading**: Load images/components only when needed
- **Memoization**: Optimizing re-renders with `React.memo`
- **Error Boundaries**: Catch and handle JavaScript errors in React components

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## Project Structure

- `src/Concepts/` — Each folder demonstrates a specific React concept with simple, focused examples.
- `src/Concepts/Error-Boundary/` — Example of error boundaries in React.
- `src/App.jsx` — Main entry point, switch between concepts as needed.
